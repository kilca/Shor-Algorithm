# RSA Algorithm

You can find the implementation of the RSA algorithm in the file named : "RSA.ipynb". It's an example without any library about how RSA work

RSA is a public key cryptosystem used to secure data transmission by encrypting and decrypting message with public and private keys. It uses the practical difficulty of factorizing prime numbers

# Shor Algorithm

You can find the implementation of the Shor Algorithm in the file named "Shor.ipynb".

Shor algorithm is a quantum computer algorithm made by  Peter Shor for finding prime factors of an integer. With this algorithm and a quantum computer, it's technically possible to crack the RSA.

The implementation of Shor was made with Qiskit library and contrary to a lot of example in the internet work with any N given.

In opposite to the basic Shor algorithm, we simplified this algorithm by creating ourself a U gate with arithmetic instead of multiple swap gate.
